# Game of Wordle

This is a simple replica of the popular game called Wordle. It is played in your terminal window and is solely text based.

To play, you will need to download the 'answers.txt' file containing possible answers (they are equivalent to words used in the original game). Place it in the same folder as the 'main.c' file, compile and enjoy.
